## When to use it

Foundation model for image segmentation with zero-shot transfer. Use when you need to segment any object in images using points, boxes, or masks as prompts, or automatically generate all object masks in an image.

## Example requests

Ask your agent in plain language, for example:

- *"Can you click-segment the tumor in this ultrasound image for me? I've got a point on it."*
- *"I'm working with ~400 SEM micrographs in ./sem_images/ (PNG, 2048x2048) and want per-particle masks for sizing. I ran SamAutomaticMaskGenerator with vit_h from sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth and got CUDA out of memory on a 12GB GPU. Small particles are also being missed. How do I fix this?"*
- *"I need to cut out every individual cell from my fluorescence microscopy images without training anything, and then use the masks as labels to train a smaller model later. What's a good approach?"*

## Install

```bash
# skills.sh (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot and more)
npx skills add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills --skill segment-anything-model

# GitHub CLI
gh skill install KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills segment-anything-model
```

In Claude Code you can also add the marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills` and install the whole `multimodal-and-emerging` category with `/plugin install multimodal-and-emerging@research-agent-skills`.
