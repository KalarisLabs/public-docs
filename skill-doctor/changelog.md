<Update label="2026-09-10" description="v0.1.0" tags={["Release"]}>
  ## First public release

  - **Scanning:** `scan`, `scan-all`, `diff`, `watch` and `gate` commands, with text, JSON and SARIF 2.1.0
    output.
  - **Detection:** deterministic L1 analysis for all 11 threat classes, using pattern, Unicode, entropy and
    taint engines plus a capability differ for privilege escalation.
  - **Integrations:** an MCP server (build with `--features mcp`) and the opt-in L3 behavioral sandbox.
  - **Reproducible output:** `--deterministic` gives byte-identical results, and `--offline` is on by
    default.
  - **Exit codes:** `0` clean, `1` error, `2` findings, `3` coverage below threshold.

  **Security**

  - Everything sent to a model first passes through `skill-doctor-neutralize` (SD-11 protection).
  - Higher layers can only add findings. They never remove, downgrade or reclassify L1 findings.
  - Findings, reports and logs show secret names, never secret values.

  crates.io versions 0.2.0, 0.2.2 and 0.2.3 were pre-release prototypes and are yanked. 0.1.0 is the first
  supported release.
